          In the year 20xx, we emitted a total of X kg CO2 indirectly . X kg CO2
          was emitted directly by us. Compared to earlier years, we decreased
          both our indirect and direct carbon emissions by X kg and X kg,
          respectively. See figure 1 for an overview.

          Of these emissions, X% was caused by energy used for electricity, a
          total of X kg. Our current source(s) of electricity is/are X,
          primarily. We hope to improve our carbon footprint related to
          electricity by implementing X, which will cost us X, and as a result,
          X kg of carbon emissions will be saved.

          As far as transportation is concerned, in 20xx we emitted a total of X
          kg carbon. As of the end of 20xx, our fleet consisted of X. In the
          (near) future, we hope to reduce our transportation-related emissions
          by investing in X. An investment of â‚¬X will be needed.

          To reduce our carbon footprint in the coming years, we intend to
          invest in F. As a result, our direct carbon emissions are estimated to
          improve, as can be seen in the figure below.
